# RedEdr

RedEdr will record the events generated by a process. Either its ETW (-TI) events, 
or use ntdll hooking to record the syscalls. It will gather more information about 
the process as needed. 

## Project Structure 

RedEdr is intended to be run as a long running process or service, which observes
processes based on their names. 

It consists of different components: 
* RedEdr: Records ETW, provides command line interface and web UI, and manages and orchastrates the other components
* RedEdrDll: The DLL which will be injected in processes for hooking. Used by RedEdrDriver
* RedEdrPplService: Records ETW-TI data as PPL
* RedEdrDriver: Records kernel events, and performs DLL injection
* RedEdrTester: Debug project to test some parts of RedEdr
* elam_driver: An empty driver signed with a certificate. Required to load RedEdrPplService
* Shared: C defines usable by all components
* RedEdrShared: Some code shared by some components

The communication between components is implemented using Windows pipes.
